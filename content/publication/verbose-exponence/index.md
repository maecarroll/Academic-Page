abstract: Multiple exponence is the multiple marking of the same feature or
  category within a single word. Distributed exponence is the occurrence of
  morphological structure such that providing a precise interpretation of a
  category can only be determined after considering more than one morphological
  formative. I propose the term verbose exponence to capture the common ground
  between these phenomena, i.e. all situations involving multiple morphological
  formatives sensitive to some common information. From this definition, a
  typology based on informational overlap emerges with types of verbose
  exponence corresponding to types of set interactions. The typology
  incorporates known related phenomena, such as overlapping exponence, while
  providing a sophisticated framework for describing previously unnamed
  phenomena. This typology is naturally cast in set-theoretic terms and formal
  definitions are provided for all assumptions and points in the typology. Such
  an approach provides precise articulations of the typological space but also
  of morphological redundancy, a property often associated with multiple
  exponence.
