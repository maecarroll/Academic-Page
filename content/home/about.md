I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEvfJrPrWLlHeuMdw1z-xeYAHErTg) and the [School of Culture, History & Language](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchl.anu.edu.au%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGBmDwbMikO5MSAA5rALi3XT178kg) at the Australian National University.

Prior to my current fellowship, I was a [Newton International Fellow](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newtonfellowships.org&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEphVa99YHJqaEwt0VVXNz9V-L9oA) at the [Surrey Morphology Group](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsmg.surrey.ac.uk&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFLm-GzARDpX2TnjkQ4zoNmB_-2Jw) where I retain visitor status.

I am fascinated by the exuberant and finely detailed structures found in languages which linguists call 'morphological complexity.' I explore this using traditional qualitative linguistics (description, typology and historical linguistics) enhanced with computational and mathematical methodologies.

I am interested in role that variation, function and adaptation might play in explaining linguistic structures.

The core of my work is fieldwork on undescribed and (often) endangered languages of New Guinea. I practice community-led partnerships in language documentation to produce collections of endangered languages serving both scientific and community needs.
